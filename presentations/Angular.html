<dt>AngularJS - Overview</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>Declarative style added to HTML</dt>
<dd><pre>
Adds a construct for the browser - directives
Primarily designed for CRUD operations => Forms and form validations. 
Not applicable for apps containing plenty of granular elements as part of the DOM which implies performance overhead as well as intensive and tricky DOM manipulation.
Attaching new behaviour to DOM elements
Grouping of HTML into reusable components
Client side templating framework
AngularJS provides live bindings => two way binding
</pre></dd>
<dt>When to use</dt>
<dd><pre>
1. Decouple DOM manipulation from app logic => Improves testability of the code
2. Testing difficulty is improved by the way the code is structure
3. Decouple client side of an app from server side => dev progress independently
4. Framework guides the entire journey of building an app => from designing the UI through writing the business logic, to testing
</pre></dd>
<dt>What problems it solves</dt>
<dd><pre>
1. Registering callbacks - Not needed
2. Manipulating HTML DOM - Not needed
3. Code to Marshalling data to and from the UI - Only the code describing the overall flow of the application is required
4. No need to write lots of code to initialize the code
</pre></dd>
<dt>Flow</dt>
<dd><pre>
HTML Template ---(AngularJS compiler)---DOM (this is called the View)

HTML Template contains 
	-> new markup as "directives" => this manipulates the DOM. Possible to create user defined directives to manipulate DOM. Directives are the only place where DOM can be manipulated

	-> new markup as "expressions"
		 => javascript-like code snippet 
		 => contains variables within angular defined scope. 
		 => read and write variables. values in variables within a scope is model

	-> new markup as "filter"
		=> formats result of an expression to display to user
</pre></dd>
<dt>AngularJS Controllers</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> Controller constructor => Exposes variables and functionality to expressions and directives
-> Controller instance is attached to an element. It is available to that element and all its children.
-> Binding happens with variables and methods exposed by controller
</pre></dd>
<dt>AngularJS Services</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> View independent business logic separated from contoller and placed in services so that they can be reused and accessed from other parts of application
-> Also for loose coupling
</pre></dd>
<dt>Dependency Injection</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> Everything within Angular (directives, filters, controllers, services, ...) created and wired using DI
-> DI container is called Injector
-> Modules holds a registry of all components to resolve dependencies
-> Starts with the module defined in ng-app and then the other modules this depends on
-> In the example, invoice2 => finance2
</pre></dd>
<dt>Angular Module</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> First parameter is a module name followed by aray of dependent modules
-> Parameters are passed first in the array followed by constructor function taking same number of parameters.  Params are passed in the same order to the constructor function
</pre></dd>
<dt>One way data binding</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> Model and template components bound to view once
-> Changes to either model or view not automatically reflected in the view
-> Write code to sync view with model and model with view
</pre></dd>
<dt>Two way data binding</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> Template when compiled creates the view 
-> Any changes to view instantly reflected in model
-> Any changes in the model are propogated to the view
-> Model is the single source of truth for the application state
-> View is just an instant projection of model
-> So controller is completely separated from view
-> Controller can be tested in isolation without the view and related DOM/browser dependency
</pre></dd>
<dt>Controllers</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> It is a javascript constructor function that is used to augment the angular scope (root scope)
-> Constructor is invoked when ng-controller directive refers to the controler
-> A new child scope is injectable to the controller's constructor function as $scope
</pre></dd>
<dt>When to use controllers</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> Set up initial state of $scope
-> Add behaviour to $scope
</pre></dd>
<dt>When not to use controllers</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> Presentation logic or DOM manipulation (use data binding and directives)
-> Format input (use angular form controls)
-> Filter output (use angular filters)
-> Share code and/or state across controllers (use angular services)
-> Manage life cycle of other components (use dependency injection)
</pre></dd>
<dt>Things to remember</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> ng-controller directive creates a scope for the template
-> Scope is managed by controller instance
-> Controller constructor is hidden for direct access
-> Assigning a property to $scope creates or updates the model
-> Controller methods and properties are available in the template for the element where ng-controller is specified as well as for its children
</pre></dd>
<dt>Scope inheritance</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> ng-controller creates a new child scope
-> Nested controllers give raise to hierarchy of scopes that inherit from each other
-> $scope at each hierarchy level will have access to $scope defined higher up the hierarchy
</pre></dd>
<dt>HTML Compiler</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> Allows one to attach behavior to any HTML element or attribute
-> Even create new HTML eleements or attributes with custom behavior
-> The behavior extensions are called directives
-> Happens in browser and not server side
</pre></dd>
<dt>Need for directives</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> HTML as a declarative language very difficult to program
</pre></dd>
<dt>Compilation phases</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> Compile: Travers the DOM, collect all directives, generate linking function
-> Link: Combine directives with scope, reflect changes in the scope model in the view and produce live view
-> Compilation produces stable DOM with element instance bound to a model item instance without changing. Code gets hold of elements and register event handlers
</pre></dd>
<dt>Compilation of Directives</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> Browser travers DOM and matches directives
		=> Single element can match multiple directives
		=> DOM element has list of directives
-> After all directives of DOM element is gathered, compiler sorts by their priority
-> Each directive's compile functions are executed
		=> compile function may change the DOM
		=> compile function returns a link function
		=> link function from each directive combined to form a "combined" link function
		=> combined link function invokes each directive's link function
-> Compiler links template with scope by invoking combined linking function
		=> Registering listeners on the elements and setting up $watch with the scope as each directive is configured
-> Result is live View
</pre></dd>
<dt>How $compile works</dt>
<dd><pre>
var $compile = ...; // injected into your code
var scope = ...;
var parent = ...; // DOM element where the compiled template can be appended

var html = '<div ng-bind="exp"></div>';

// Step 1: parse HTML into DOM element
var template = angular.element(html);

// Step 2: compile the template
var linkFn = $compile(template);

// Step 3: link the compiled template with the scope.
var element = linkFn(scope);

// Step 4: Append to DOM (optional)
parent.appendChild(element);
</pre></dd>
<dt>Custom Directives</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> Markers on a DOM element - attribute, element-name, comment or CSS class
-> Directs Angular HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to the DOM element or transform the DOM element and its children
</pre></dd>
<dt>Normalization of directive names</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> Strip x- and data- from the front of the element/attributes
-> Convert the :, -, or _-delimited name to camelCase
-> Prefer ng-* over other options
</pre></dd>
<dt>Directive types</dt>
<dd><pre>
-> Element names, attributes, class names, comments
-> Prefer element names and attributes over class names and comments
-> Use ng-repeat-start and ng-repeat-end over comment directives
</pre></dd>
<dt>Custom directives</dt>
<dd><pre>
	1. Invoke module.directive with the normalized name and factory function
	2. Factory function returns object with various obtions for directives behavior
	3. Factory function is invoked only once when the compiler matches the directive for the first time
	4. Prefer using definition object over function
	5. Prefix with some letters so that it doesn't conflict in future
</pre></dd>
<dt>Options</dt>
<dd><pre>
	=> Use template
	=> Use template-url to load html fragment from html file
	=> Can't access scope
</pre></dd>
<dt>Restrict Options</dt>
<dd><pre>
	=> 'A' matches attribute
	=> 'E' matches element
	=> 'C' matches class names
	=> Restrictions can be combined
	=> restrict: 'E'

	.directive('myCustomer', function() {
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    templateUrl: 'my-customer.html'
  };
}
</pre></dd>
<dt>attribute vs element directive</dt>
<dd><pre>
	=> Use element when creating component in control of the template
	=> Use attribute to decorate existing element with new functionality
